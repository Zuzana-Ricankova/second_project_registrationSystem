Project Description:
The System is designed to ensure the fair distribution of resources by managing user data effectively. This system includes a REST API for handling user registration and information retrieval, storing data in a relational database with strict constraints to maintain data integrity. The system emphasizes clean code and proper code structure, with clear separation of concerns across different layers of the application.

Project Requirements:
REST API: The application provides a REST interface for interacting with the user data.
Database: User data is stored in a relational database.
Code Structure: Proper separation of concerns with distinct layers (controller, service, repository).
Clean Code: Emphasis on maintainable and readable code.
Postman Tests: API endpoints are tested using Postman, with export provided.
SQL Scripts: SQL commands for database generation are included.
